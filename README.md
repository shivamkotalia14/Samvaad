# Samvaad

## Overview

Samvaad is an innovative communication application developed to assist deaf and mute individuals by offering seamless translation between Gujarati Sign Language and English. This platform aims to eliminate communication barriers, fostering interaction between deaf individuals and their families, teachers, and peers.

Utilizing advanced deep learning techniques, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Samvaad is trained on a modified Gujarati Sign Language dataset. This ensures highly accurate real-time translations, making communication more effective in various contextsâ€”educational, social, and professional.

Samvaad not only facilitates the translation of sign language but also empowers users by providing an AI-based chatbot that can understand and respond to both text and sign language queries. This feature enhances the learning experience, allowing students to receive assistance and clarification in real-time. The user-friendly interface and offline capabilities further ensure accessibility for all users, regardless of their technological background.

In collaboration with local NGOs and schools, Samvaad continually gathers data to refine its deep learning models, enhancing the platform's reliability as a language translation tool. With its scalable architecture, Samvaad is designed to adapt to other languages and integrate new functionalities, promoting inclusivity and accessibility in communication.
